# 🎯 Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System

A data science project demonstrating customer segmentation using machine learning and providing tailored product recommendations. This project highlights my ability to work with complex datasets, apply clustering algorithms, and develop visual insights for business strategy.

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System** project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior to identify distinct customer groups. I applied unsupervised learning techniques such as **K-means** and **hierarchical clustering**, and built a recommendation system based on the segmented groups. The results are visualized through interactive dashboards, useful for driving marketing strategies.

### 🎯 Objective
To segment customers based on purchasing behavior and recommend personalized products or services, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- **🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Utilized Python libraries such as `pandas` and `NumPy` to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
  
- **📈 Clustering Techniques**: Applied **K-means** and **hierarchical clustering** algorithms to categorize customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.

- **🔮 Predictive Modeling**: Developed a recommendation system to suggest products or services based on customer segments, using collaborative filtering techniques.

- **📊 Data Visualization**: Used `Matplotlib` to generate visual insights and optional **Tableau** dashboards to provide an interactive view of customer clusters and recommendations.

- **🧠 Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for visualizing high-dimensional data in two-dimensional plots.

- **📊 Business Insight Generation**: Delivered actionable insights for each customer segment, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies for different customer groups.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **🐍 Python**: The core programming language used for data processing, model building, and analysis.
- **🗂️ Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **📦 Scikit-learn**: Implemented clustering algorithms such as **K-means** and **hierarchical clustering**.
- **📊 Matplotlib**: For visualizing customer segments and trends in data.
- **📊 Tableau / Power BI**: (Optional) Created interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore customer segment insights and recommendations.
- **📓 Jupyter Notebook**: Documented the project with code, analysis, and visualizations in an interactive format.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle's Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation). It contains customer demographic and purchasing data, including features such as:

- **🆔 Customer ID**
- **👤 Age**
- **💵 Annual Income**
- **📊 Spending Score** (score assigned based on purchasing habits)

## 🛠️ Process

### 1. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`, performed exploratory analysis, and checked for missing values and outliers.
- Scaled the data to ensure it was suitable for clustering algorithms, which are sensitive to data scaling.

### 2. 📈 Clustering
- Applied the **K-means** algorithm to identify clusters based on customer features like income and spending score.
- Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters, balancing between cluster size and variability within clusters.
- Visualized the results, highlighting distinct customer segments.

### 3. 🎯 Recommendations
- Built a recommendation system to suggest products or services based on customer segments.
- Leveraged collaborative filtering techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy based on similar customer preferences.

### 4. 📊 Visualizations & Insights
- Generated scatter plots to visualize customer segments and understand how income, age, and spending habits define each cluster.
- Optional **Tableau/Power BI Dashboards** provide non-technical users with an interactive platform to explore the data and recommendations.

### 5. 🔍 Insights
- Segmented customers into groups such as "High Spenders," "Low Income Shoppers," and "Young Frequent Buyers," based on key features.
- Proposed actionable strategies such as personalized marketing campaigns for each customer segment, which can help businesses optimize their sales strategy.

## 📈 Key Results

- **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Identified Customer Segments**: Through clustering, customers were grouped into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.
- **🔮 Tailored Recommendations**: Built a recommendation engine that provides personalized product suggestions for each customer group, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: Developed an optional interactive dashboard (using **Tableau/Power BI**) that visualizes customer segments and offers actionable insights for business stakeholders.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project showcases my proficiency in **data preprocessing**, **machine learning algorithms**, and **data visualization**. By leveraging customer segmentation, businesses can better understand their audience and develop more targeted marketing campaigns. The recommendation system enhances this by suggesting personalized products for each customer group, making the system valuable for boosting customer engagement and business revenue.
